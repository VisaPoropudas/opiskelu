            The API has two functions that you can use in your code: 

            fetchAPI(date) - This function accepts a date as a parameter and returns an array of available reservation times for the provided date 

            submitAPI(formData) - This function accepts the booking form data as a parameter and will return true if the data was successfully submitted.

            Update the booking form to display the available times from the API
            Update the initializeTimes function that you previously created to use the fetchData API function to return the available times for today’s date. 

            Tip: You can create a Date object to represent today’s date.

            Update the updateTimes function that you previously created to use the fetchData API function. Remember, you dispatched the selected date to the updateTimes function. This should be passed to the fetchData function as a parameter.
